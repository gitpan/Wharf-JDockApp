   - jettero alter'd this distribution so it's now Wharf::'d

0.9:  Sun Jul 30 23:18:23 EDT 2000
   - jettero got ClearWindow to work!!!! Now I just need to
     finish the docs!

0.8:  Sun Jul 30 22:58:38 EDT 2000
   - jettero tested lotsa stuff... and concluded that Clear
     Window is one of the only things that's still broken.
     This is just about ready to go! :)

0.7:  Sun Jul 30 12:23:47 EDT 2000
   - jettero got an actual window to pop up from test.pl

0.6:  Sun Jul 30 10:26:03 EDT 2000
   - jettero discovered that appsupport.c was the wrong
     approach... jtools.xs became my application ... go
     perl!

0.5:  Sun Jul 30 00:30:11 EDT 2000
   - jettero got jtools/ to compile ... finally. We're going
     to have trouble with the .xs stuff

0.4:  Sat Jul 29 13:24:27 EDT 2000
   - jettero wtf is a boot_jtools anyway? ... Starting the
     h2xs over for jtools ... *frown*
   - The correct solution would have been to put jtools.o in
     the Makefile.PL

0.4:  Sat Jul 29 13:12:10 EDT 2000
   - jettero added makemakes and got jtools/ to compile with
     the new jtools/appsupport.c. App Support is a funny
     funny legacy naming scheme. See, the old setup and
     do_expose (et cetera) were supposed to be defined int
     he app itself. That won't really work with perl though.
     :)

0.3:  Sat Jul 29 12:18:26 EDT 2000
   - jettero thinks jtools/ nearly ready. He also made
     distclean...

0.2:  Sat Jul 29 12:03:58 EDT 2000
   - jettero went back to square 1 and started jtools/ over
     ...

0.4:  Sat Jul 29 11:38:52 EDT 2000
   - jettero got jtools/ to almost compile ... almost

0.3:  Sat Jul 29 11:33:26 EDT 2000
   - jettero realized that xutils/ needs to be
     jtools/xutils/ ... and moved it thusly

0.2:  Sat Jul 29 11:28:46 EDT 2000
   - jettero got xutils/ and jtools/ to compile!

0.1:  Sat Jul 29 11:00:31 EDT 2000
   - jettero installed I manifestbuilder fix_alsos xutils/
     jtools/
